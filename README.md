# Whatsapp-autosend-PLC

**The source code are in *wassap* folder, the executable are in wassap\WindowsFormsApplication2\bin\Debug**

This is a program purposed to read any error trigger from PLC and send whatsapp message to listed contacts that has been chosen. In this source code, you *can* change custom message. For actual application, you must set your PLC connection with PC by Ethernet and setting *axcopc1* toolbox on Design tab.

Tutorial of *axcopc*/*copc32* could be found on its official website http://www.eda.co.th/COPC.htm. This activeX is not free, so you just can use it in trial mode for 30 days or buy the license for 3000 USD (so expensive). Let me know if you have other free and open source alternative :)
